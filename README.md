# MiscStuff
Stuff that may be helpful or required for Psychtoolbox-3 uses, but doesn't quite make sense to be bundled within PTB.

Some of the files contained here may also be useful for users of other Neuroscience research software.

Licenses in this repository (or dumping ground, to be more exact) will vary from folder to folder, so check the specific subfolders for licenses and conditions.

Some stuff here may disappear when it fulfilled its purpose. E.g., this repo may contain precompiled drivers or runtime libraries from other upstream projects to enhance neuroscience related functionality in existing Linux distributions, like GNU/Debian or Ubuntu or derivatives of those. This is provided as a convenience until relevant components are available in a simpler way. E.g., if common Linux distributions or related ppa's contain sufficiently up-to-date versions of these components as easily installable packages then the components contained here will be deleted, as simply updating your Linux distribution or installing a package from the distro package repository is much more convenient, provides more up to date functionality and higher security - as security issues will be dealt with by the distro, instead of not being dealt with at all here.
